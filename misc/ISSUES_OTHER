==================================================
== Other obscure corners where bugs are likely to lurk

(1) A_retape has a second argument that controls the form of the retaping
operation. Is it bullet-proof against mal-formed inputs.

(2) Review what A_lenmin and A_minlen are doing.

(3) All of the sub-sequential code was developed in the later part of my
time at U of Waterloo. It was not used by anyone but me and has bugs. It is
also desperately needs to be re-factored. Fortunately, it has a natural
structure as a modified form of the subsets construction over a *-semiring
structure. This will be explored in a separate repo in the future (??).

(4) Aclsseq: *** Here be dragons ***
Aclsseq is a special case. I as trying to come up with a form of a
closure operation over transduction composition. To make this simpler, I
restricted the transductions to subsequential functions. NB: mathematically,
this is impossible in general because the closure of even a sseq-function is
not rational. I was looking for interesting special cases. I hadn't found any
before I left U of Waterloo, and never revisited the problem.

(5) Why do I need the declarations of fileno and isascii to suppress warnings
with the -ansi option?
