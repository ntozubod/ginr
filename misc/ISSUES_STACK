== Limits on maximum stack size

(1) A_trim does a deep recursion that reaches a depth of the maximum path
length from the start state. Each frame has 2 SHORTs and a pointer (12 bytes).

(2) A_lameq does a deep recursion that reaches a depth of the maximum path
length of lambda transitions. Each frame has 2 ints and 2 pointers (24 bytes).
***** could these 2 ints be SHORTs?
***** could one of the pointers be eliminated?

(3) A_lamcm does a deep recursion that reaches a depth of the maximum path
length of lambda transitions. Each frame has 1 int (4 bytes).

(4) A_clsure does a deep recursion that reaches a depth of the maximum path
length of lambda transitions. Each frame has 1 int and 2 pointers (20 bytes).

(5) A_enum does a deep recursion that reaches a depth of the maximum path
length from the start state. Each frame has 1 SHORT and 1 pointer (10 bytes).
Probably doesn't matter because printing from each call. (It would be a bigger
problem.)

(6) A_card does a deep recursion that reaches a depth of the maximum path
length from the start state. Each frame has 1 SHORT, 1 int  and 1 pointer
(14 bytes).
